# Bootstrap-Portfolio


## Description 


This is my second attempt to showcasing skills during my journey as a web developer.
This portfolio was created using Bootstrap as well as HTML/CSS. Customising certain features from Bootstrap such as Jumbotron, is a level up from my first portfolio that I created.
